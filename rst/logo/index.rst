SVG Club Logo
#############

When I first joined the club, their logo was found only in an image file. The
original artist created the logo manually, then scanned it for club use. The
original is no longer available.

I decided that we needed a more permanent logo, one that could be scaled for a
variety of purposes. I also decided that we needed a badge we could use on
model airplanes, or club membership cards.

The solution was to take the image file and see if I could turn it into a pure
SVG file. This note details the process I went through to come up with the new
logo.

Logo Composition
****************

The image file had only a few basic elements:

    * The US Flag masked by a heart shape

    * The heart shape path

    * A Modeler launching an airplane

    * The Airplane itself

    * The name "HAFFA" styled in what looked like the Papyrus font

Flag Geometry
*************

The dimensions of the flag are well defined. iHere is the basic geometry from
http://https://www.chamberofcommerce.org/usflag/flagspecs.html:

..  image:: specflag.gif
    :align: center

Where:

    * **A** (hoist) = 1.0

    * **B** (fly) = 1.9

    * **C** (Union hoist) = 7/13

    * **D** (Union fly) = 0.76

    * **E** = 0.054

    * **F** = 0.054

    * **G** = 0.063

    * **H** = 0.063

    * **K** diameter of star = 0.0616
