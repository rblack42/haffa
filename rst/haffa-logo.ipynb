    "The HAFFA logo was originally drawn up by Diane Basta and scanned to provide an image file. That image file has been in use for a long time, appearing on club hats, tee-shirts and the club website. However, scaling the logo up for use on banners, or incorporating it in a badge for use on models or membership cards has not been practical. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In this note, we will construct an SVG file that can provide the missing functionality. We will use a Python Jupyter notebook so you can see how this new logo is being generated from the original club logo.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logo Components\n",
    "\n",
    "The original logo has five basic elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The US Flag\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A heart shape mask used to cut off parts of the flag\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A Modeler launching an airplane\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A free-flight  model\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The text \"HAFFA\" styled in what looks like the papyrus font\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tracing the image file\n",
    "\n",
    "I started off by using **Snagit** to crop off the modeler, airplane and HAFFA text from the image file. The flag and heart are well defined, so there was no need to attempt to process those parts of the logo image. I broke up the text into the three letters used so each could be processed individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ouce I had isolated those components, I used **Inkscape** to trace the  parts, producing a rough SVG version of each item. The resulting vector form of each component was very messy, since the resolution of the images used was fairly low. \n",
    "\n",
    "I then manually edited the images using **Inkscape**, deleting many of the generated points to smooth up the final SVG for each item. Here are the component files I produced:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pilot:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"_images/haffa-pilot.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Airplane:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"_images/haffa-airplane.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Letter H:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"_images/haffa-letter-H.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Letter A:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"_images/haffa-letter-A.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Letter F:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"_images/haffa-letter-F.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these elements stll retail the hand-drawn feel. We may tweak them as we build large format images from the final SVG we produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a Basic SVG file\n",
    "\n",
    "SVG is a text format, based on XML, which uses \"tags\" to identify each fundamental component of an image. If you have not seen this type of markup before, the idea is pretty simple. Here is a basic \"tag\":\n",
    "\n",
    "    <tagname parameters>\n",
    "      tag body\n",
    "    </tag>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Other tags can be placed in the tag body area producing a nested structure. It is common to indent those nested elements for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVG defines a lot of tag names, each performing some action when the image file is displayed. Some tags cause visible drawing effects to appear. Other tags are mre administrative in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the outermost tag in any SVG file is the 88svg88 tag itself. we will see an example of this in a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could just type up the svg file directly, but there are many calculations needed to come up with coordinate values we will need to placing the components of the logo, so I decided to generate the logo file using **Python**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that you have a machine with **Python** installed, you will need to install the **drawSVG** package using the standard python **pip** tool if you want to follow along with this process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make sure we have the required setup with a simple test."

    "We need to define the drawing area we will be using to create this logo. SVG uses a simple user coordinate system, which traditionally maps to pixels on a computer screen. The physical size of the image depends on the resolution of the display you use to view the final image, so we assume it is just a dimensionless integer numbe3r that ranges from zero to some value in each direction. Normally, SVG sets up a coordinate system that is a bit odd to most humans. the **x** coordinate runs from zero at the left side of the image to some number at the right of the image. The **y** coordinate starts at zero at the top of the image, and runs down to some value. Fortunately, we specify the size of the drawing area in user coordinates using simple **width** and **height** parameters.\n",

If you look at the coordinates used in the **draw.Lines** function pairs are pairs of values defining an **x**,**y** point. The first point starts the drawing, and lines are drawn between each next point and the previous point specified. That gives three sides for the example box.

You cannot start a tag inside of another tag pair and not close it before the outer closing tag.\n",
