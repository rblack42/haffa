    "The HAFFA logo was originally drawn up by Diane Basta and scanned to provide an image file. That image file has been in use for a long time, appearing on club hats, tee-shirts nd the club website. However, scaling thta logo up for use on banners, or incorporating it in a badge for use on models or membership cards has not been practical. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this note, we will construct an SVG file that can provide the missing functionality. We will use a Python Jupyter notebook so you can see how this new logo is being generated from the original club logo.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logo Components\n",
    "\n",
    "The original logo has five basic elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The US Flag\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A heart shape mask used to cut off parts of the flag\n",
    "\n",

    "4. A free-flight  model\n",

    "5. The text \"HAFFA\" styled in what looks like the papyrus font\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tracing the image file\n",
    "\n",
    "I started off by using **Snagit** to crop off the modeler, airplane and HAFFA text from the image file. The flag and heart are well defined, so there was no need to attempt to process those parts of the logo. I broke up the text into the three letters used so each could be processed individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ouce I had isolated those components, I used **Inkscape** to trace the  parts, producing a rough SVG version of each item. The resulting vector form of each component was very messy, since the resolution of the images used was fairly low. \n",
    "\n",
    "I then manually edited the imaged using **Inkscape**, deleting many of the generated points to smooth up the final SVG for each item. Here are the component files I produced:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pilot:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"_images/haffa-pilot.svg\">\n",

    "When looking at this rsult in isolation, there are a few concerns. The head is a bit odd, and the legs are a bit out of line. at small scales, this is not very noticable, but in larger sizes we may need ot tweak things a bit.\n",
    "### Airplane:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"_images/haffa-airplane.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The airplane is not too bad, although the dihedral is not even on both sides. Minor tweaks can fix this.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"_images/haffa-letter-H.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "These leters still have a hand-drawn feel that may be fine for the final logo. This might be. club-vote issue.\n",

We could just type up the svg file directly, but there are many calculations needed to come up with coordinate values we will need to placing the components of the logo, so I decided to generate the logo file using **Python**. \n",

    "Next, we need to define the drawing area we will be using to create this logo. SVG uses two concepts to control how images are displayed. First, there is a user coordinate system, which traditionally maps to pixels on a computer screen. The physical size of the image depends on the resolution of the display you use to view the final image, so we assume it is just a dimensionless integer numbe3r that ranges from zero to some value in each direction. Normally, SVG sets up a coordinate system that is a bit odd to most humans. the **x** coordinate runs from zero at the left side of the image to some number at the right of the image. The **y** coordinate starts at zero at the top of the image, and runs down to some value. Fortunately, we specify the size of the drawing area in user coordinates using a **width** and 88height** parameter.\n",
